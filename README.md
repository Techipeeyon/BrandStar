# BrandStar
BrandStar is a web application built using Flask which provides an analytical solution for the companies who want to analyze their product.


## Inspiration 
There are not tools online that provide a way to analyze your own product. A person could hire an analyst for the same but what if this could be done free-of-cost. This really is the inspiration behind building BrandStar
